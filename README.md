# Proxy-climb

Incremental Reverse Proxy Learning and Documentation:

## Overview

This is my first project. The concept is simple, set up a reverse proxy and use wrk to test performance.

## Goals
- Measure response times through a reverse proxy
- Identify bottlenecks under concurrent load
- Document setup and reproducible tests
- Understand OS-level system tuning for network performance

## Tech Stack 
- Reverse Proxy: Go (custom implementation)
- Load Testing: wrk
- OS: Manjaro Linux 26.0.2
- Hardware: Omen 15-ax252nr (Intel i7-7700HQ)
- Cores: 4 Physical, 8 Logical

## System Tuning & OS-Level Concepts

## Setup 

## Running Tests 

## Results 

## Learning Notes

This project documents the journey of understanding reverse proxies from first principles, including both application-level code and the underlying OS/network behavior that governs real-world performance.
